"""
This module retrieves information from the top500 supercomputers (SC) table
from top500.org and defines the following indicators:

    a) The total peak performance (Rpeak [TFlop/s]) of the SC in a given country.

    Ð±) The ratio of peak performance of SCs based on accelerators to the entire
    performance of all SC in the given country.

How To Use This Module
======================
(See the individual classes, methods, and attributes for details.)

    1. Download the TOP500 exel file on your computer.

    2. Convert it to the .csv format (Use comma separation, pay attention to encoding).

    3. In the get_the_full_table() function define the path to the .csv table.

    4. Use get_the_countrys_total_peak_performance(region) function to get the total peak performance (Rpeak [TFlop/s])
     of the SCs in the given country.
            The countries you can get the info about (The :arg region must be exactly similar as shown below:
                a) 'China'
                b) 'United States'
                c) 'EU' (European Union)
                d) 'Russia'
                e) 'Others'.

    5. Use get_accelerators_to_entire_performance_ratio(region) function to get the ratio of peak performance of SCs
     based on accelerators to the entire performance of all SCs in the given country.
            The countries you can get the info about (The :arg region must be exactly similar as shown down:
                a) 'China'
                b) 'United States'
                c) 'EU' (European Union)
                d) 'Russia'
                e) 'Others'.

    6. If you need to calculate the total peak performance over the all top500 list use get_total_peak_performance()
    func.
